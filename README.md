# basicGates
Basic Logic Gates implemented in Verilog with simulation testbenches. Includes behavioral and dataflow modeling of AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR gates.

This repository contains Verilog implementations of fundamental logic gates:
- AND
- OR
- NOT
- NAND
- NOR
- XOR
- XNOR
## Features
- Simple and clean Verilog modules
- Automated testbenches using `for`, `case`, and `initial` blocks
- Suitable for beginners
